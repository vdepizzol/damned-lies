<p>{% blocktrans %}Damned Lies is able to filter strings which are seldom visible in user interfaces, so as translation teams can concentrate on most visible strings.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans with "http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/toolkit/pogrep" as pogrep_url%}The most typical case is the strings from schema files, hence the default filter is filtering out strings which come from files having "gschema.xml.in" in their name. Technically speaking, the filter is using the <a href="{{ pogrep_url }}">pogrep command from the Translate Toolkit</a>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}When you see a po file or a table header containing "(red.)" or "(reduced)", it means that the target files have been filtered as stated above.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}If you think you found a better filter for a specific module, please <a href="{{ bug_url }}">submit a bug report</a> with your proposal.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
