Damned Lies: better statistics for Gnome
****************************************


There are lies, damned lies, and statistics! â€” not[1] Benjamin Disraeli


Damned Lies is designed to provide translation status for intltool
(for UI translation) and gnome-doc-utils (for docs) using modules.
Currently, the only supported source-code fetching method is via CVS,
but I plan to support others (SVN, tarballs) as well.

It also provides a nice outlook on all releases you've got, but this
is only useful for complicated compilations of software such as Gnome
itself.


On naming
---------
Well, we are obviously more correct than just any statistics out
there, but still giving out crap (lies), so we must be somewhere 
in between: damned lies it is!
