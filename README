This is a re-implementation of the Damned-Lies application
in a Django app. Damned-Lies has been originally written by
Danilo Segan (danilo@gnome.org). This implementation has been
written by Claude Paroz (claude@2xlibre.net) and Stéphane
Raimbault (stephane.raimbault@gmail.com).

The former XML files (modules, releases, people, translation
teams) have been replaced by a database.

The Data model is in the /docs directory.

The middle-term objective is to merge this code with the Transifex 
application (http://transifex.org).

Requirements
============

1 - Django 1.0.X

2 - Python 2.5 (for hashlib module).

3 - [Optional] Django Evolution is an extension to Django that allows
    you to track changes in your models over time, and to update the
    database to reflect those changes.

    svn checkout http://django-evolution.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
    
    Define USE_DJANGO_EVOLUTION to True in settings.py to use it.

    Run './manage.py syncdb' before any model changes and './manage.py
    evolve --hint --execute' after.

4 - [Optional] Django Debug Toolbar
    git clone git://github.com/dcramer/django-debug-toolbar.git
    Define USE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR to True in settings.py to use it.

5 - [Optional] python-openid and django-openid (see OpenID support below).

Installation
============

1 - Rename settings_sample.py to settings.py and review settings
    (please refer to Database configuration below for more informations).

2 - Run 'python manage.py syncdb'

3 - Configure Sites in admin interface to define the 'View on site'
    link.

OpenID support
==============
If you want OpenID support, checkout Simon Willison's django_openid
package (WIP, part of django-openid, not confuse!): 
svn co http://django-openid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/django_openid
Put it somewhere in your Python path and uncomment 'django_openid' in your
settings.py INSTALLED_APPS.
This package is dependant on the python-openid package to be installed on
your system.
Run 'python manage.py syncdb' and here we go!

Databases
=========

It's important to use the Unix Domain Socket connection to obtain good
performances.

PostgreSQL
----------

You just need to define DATABASE_ENGINE = 'postgresql_psycopg2' and DATABASE_NAME. Leave DATABASE_HOST setting empty to use UDS.

MySQL
-----

Create a database in UTF8, either with default-character-set = utf8
under [mysqld] section in the my.cnf file or with an explicit 'create
database bla charset=utf8;'

In settings.py:

DATABASE_HOST = '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'

DATABASE_OPTIONS = {
    'read_default_file': '/etc/mysql/my.cnf',
    "init_command": "SET storage_engine=INNODB"
}

Grep for ANSI_QUOTES in the source code to find the models.py which
use a hack to workaround the double quotes interpretation in MySQL.
The best solution is to run the MySQL server with the ANSI_QUOTES
mode: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-sql-mode.html
(sql-mode="ANSI_QUOTES" in my.cnf) but it can be dangerous for other
applications.

Running as CGI
==============

If you don't want to setup Django with mod_python, there is a tutorial
on the Django Wiki:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/fastcgi/

You'll also find a sample init script in the /docs directory.

Translations
============

To be able to also extract strings from various database fields, a wrapper
script has been created around standard Django make_messages. The script also
copy po files in /po directory.
Run 'python manage.py update-trans' to update translations when there are
string changes.

After translation files in po directory have been updated, there is another script
to put back po files in locale/<ll>/LC_MESSAGES/django.po and call Django's
compile_messages command.
Run 'python manage.py compile-trans'
