HOW TO DEBUG
************

To debug this web application on the command line with the Python debugger,
insert "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()" where you want the program to enter the 
debugger, go to the app root directory and type:
$ export PATH_INFO=/url/you/want/to/debug
$ python index.py

PATH_INFO should not include the domain name.

TO DO
*****

Judging Translation Support Levels:
-----------------------------------
Not everything that can be counted counts; and not everything that
counts can be counted. //George Gallup

- Level 0:
  not fulfilling even Level 1 requirements

- Level 1:
  check percentage for every PO file EXCLUDING:
  - irrelevant modules (gtk+/po-properties, gstreamer, xkeyboard-config, gnome-applets/po-locations ...)
  - translations exclusively for .schemas.in files
  - special checks for what we know we can exclude?

- Level 2 (fully usable UI translation: no gconf or non-visible things translated)
  - xkeyboard-config
  - iso_codes
  - gnome-applets/po-locations (at least the relevant part: top-level
    countries and entries for relevant country for a language)
  ...

- Level 3 (complete UI translation)
  - .schemas.in translations as well
  - gnome-applets/po-locations (full translation)
  - gtk+/po-properties
  - gstreamer
  - scrollkeeper
  ...

- Level 4 (UI + docs)
  - Level 2 + docs translation

- Level 5 (full UI+docs translation)
  - Level 3 + docs translation

Level 0: unsupported
Level 1: partially supported
Level 2/3: supported
Level 4: excellent support
Level 5: "Gnome badge of honour" or "we owe you a beer" award :)


List of messages untranslated but present in POT
------------------------------------------------
Extend potdiff.py, stripping untranslated messages so we can inform
translators what they need to translate without forcing them to look
at the PO file (stop after eg. 10 differences?)


Not regenerating old stuff [DONE]
--------------------------
"regenerate" attribute on <branch>: keep branches, but don't regenerate for them


Speed optimizations
-------------------

- update only single module, branch, domain, language (to speed up on 
  PO file CVS commits)

- check if POT diff between old and new POT files is null, AND PO file 
  hasn't changed (compare mtimes), when there is no need to go through 
  entire update procedure (in update-stats.py(ui_l10n_status)) [DONE]

- allow to process only a single module/branch on e-mail notifications
  (procmail + cvs commit notifications): almost ready, only need a
  short script to start this with module/branch parameters [DONE]

SVN, bazaar, tarball source code
--------------------------------
Support other methods than CVS of fetching source code.


Better error reporting for docs
-------------------------------
- parse documents looking for mediaobjects, look for missing figures in translations, etc.


potdiff.py speed testing
************************

Input data: two random PO files of 833/844 messages with 21 differences

Measured user time using time(1).

USE_DIFFLIB (ms): 94 82 92 88 77 76 87
  average: 85.2 ~ 80

NO_DIFFLIB(ms)  : 65 59 59 60 67 61 66 61
  average: 62.3 ~ 60


run-time
********

- fuzzy_matching = 0
- generate_docs = 0

~16 minutes for 5442 UI strings, 843 documentation strings.

GNOME is in the range of 100K UI strings, 20K doc strings, which is
roughly 20 times this size, so estimated initial run-time would be
~5.5 hours.
