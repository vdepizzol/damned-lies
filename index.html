<h1>Damned Lies about Gnome</h1>

<table><tr><td width="50%" valign="top">

<h2><a href="teams/">Teams</a></h2>
<p>List of all Gnome Translation Teams, with full information such as
  primary contact (coordinator), web pages and mailing list
  information. If there is no team for your language, you can easily 
  <a href="http://live.gnome.org/TranslationProject/StartingATeam/">start
  your own team</a>.
</p>

</td><td valign="top">

<h2><a href="languages/">Languages</a></h2>
<p>List of all languages there are <a href="teams/">Translation
    Teams</a> for.  Some teams manage more than one language (usually
    just simple variants), and here you can see all the languages
    Gnome is being translated to.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">

<h2><a href="releases/">Release Sets</a></h2>
<p>List of all Gnome release sets and releases we gather stats for.</p>

<p>Examples of release sets are "Gnome Office", "Fifth Toe" or "Gnome
  2.14".  Official Gnome release sets are further divided into
  categories such as "Desktop Applications" and "Developer Platform".</p>

<p>Look here if you want to compare language support in any of these
  release sets.</p>
</td><td valign="top">

<h2><a href="module/">Modules</a></h2>
<p>List of all modules with statistics in here.</p>

<p>Modules are separate libraries or applications, with one or more
  branches of development included.  They are usually taken from CVS,
  and we keep all relevant information on them (Bugzilla details, web
  page, maintainer information,...).</p>
